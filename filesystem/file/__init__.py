# File

---

## Overview
The File module is a comprehensive utility toolset that forms part of the FileSystemPro library. 
It provides a suite of functions designed to handle various file operations such as integrity checks,
file creation, deletion, enumeration, and file splitting and reassembling.

## Features
- `Checksum Calculation:` Utilizes SHA-256 hashing to calculate file checksums for integrity verification.
- `Integrity Check:` Compares checksums of two files to verify their integrity.
- `File Creation:` Supports creating both text and binary files with specified data.
- `File Deletion:` Safely deletes files by checking for their existence before removal.
- `File Enumeration:` Enumerates all files in a given directory, providing detailed file information.
- `File Existence Check:` Determines if a file exists at a given path.
- `File Listing:` Lists all files in a specified directory.
- `File Renaming:` Renames files within a directory after checking for their existence.
- `File Reassembling:` Reassembles split files back into a single file.
- `File Splitting:` Splits a file into smaller parts based on a specified chunk size.

## Detailed Functionality
The module's functions are designed to be robust and easy to use, 
providing a high level of abstraction from the underlying file system operations.

### Checksum Calculation and Integrity Check
The `calculate_checksum` function reads a file in binary mode and calculates its SHA-256 hash, 
returning the hexadecimal digest. The `check_integrity` function uses this to compare the checksums of 
two files, which is essential for verifying that files have not been tampered with or corrupted.

### File Creation, Deletion, and Enumeration
File creation is handled by two functions: `create` for text files, 
which uses codecs to handle different encodings, and `create_binary_file` for binary files. 
The `delete` function removes a file after confirming its existence, 
while `enumerate_files` provides a comprehensive list of all files in a directory, including their metadata.

### File Existence, Listing, and Renaming
The `exists` function checks if a file is present at a specified path. 
The `list` function returns a list of all files in a directory. 
The `rename` function allows for renaming a file if it exists.

### File Reassembling and Splitting
The `reassemble_file` function is used to combine parts of a 
previously split file back into its original form. 
Conversely, the `split_file` function divides a file into smaller parts, 
each with a size defined by the `chunk_size` parameter.

## Usage
To use the functions provided by this module, 
import the module and call the desired function with the appropriate parameters:

```python
from filesystem import file as fsfile
```

    ### Overview
    Appends UTF-8 encoded text to an existing file, or creates a new file if it does not exist.

    ### Parameters:
    - file_path (str): The path to the file.
    - text (str): The text to append to the file.

    ### Returns:
    None

    ### Raises:
    - IOError: If an I/O error occurs

    ### Examples:

def calculate_checksum(file):

    # file.calculate_checksum(file)

    ---

    ### Overview
    Calculates the SHA-256 checksum of a file. This function reads the file in binary mode and updates the hash in chunks to efficiently handle large files.

    ### Parameters:
    file (str): The path to the file for which the checksum is to be calculated.

    ### Returns:
    str: The calculated hexadecimal SHA-256 checksum of the file.

    ### Raises:
    - FileNotFoundError: If the file does not exist at the specified path.
    - IOError: If there is an error reading the file.

    ### Examples:
    - Calculate and return the checksum of a file:

    ```python
    checksum = calculate_checksum("/path/to/file")
    print(checksum)
    ```

    ---
    
    ### Overview
    Compares the SHA-256 checksums of two files to verify their integrity. This function is useful for ensuring that a file has not been altered or corrupted by comparing it to a reference file.

    ### Parameters:
    file (str): The path to the file whose integrity is being checked.
    reference_file (str): The path to the reference file against which the checksum comparison is made.

    ### Returns:
    bool: Returns True if the checksums match, indicating the files are identical in content; False otherwise.

    ### Raises:
    - FileNotFoundError: If either the `file` or `reference_file` does not exist at the specified paths.
    - IOError: If there is an error reading either file during the checksum calculation.

    ### Examples:
    - Check the integrity of a file against a reference file and print the result:

    ```python
    integrity = check_integrity("/path/to/file", "/path/to/reference_file")
    print("Files are identical:", integrity)

    ---

    ### Overview
    Copies a file or a list of files from the source to the destination. This function handles both single file copying and multiple file copying while providing options for overwriting existing files and performing various validation checks.

    ### Parameters:
    - source (str or list): The path to the source file or a list of source files to be copied.
    - destination (str): The path to the destination directory where the file(s) should be copied.
    - overwrite (bool, optional): If set to True, existing files at the destination will be overwritten. Defaults to False.

    ### Raises:
    - FileNotFoundError: If the source file or any of the listed source files do not exist.
    - FileExistsError: If the file already exists in the destination and `overwrite` is set to False.
    - PermissionError: If the destination path is not writable.
    - Exception: For any unexpected errors that occur during the copying process.

    ### Examples:
    - Copying a single file without overwriting:

    ```python
    copy("path/to/source/file.txt", "path/to/destination/")
    ```

    - Copying multiple files with the option to overwrite existing files:

    ### Overview
    Splits a large file into smaller chunks. The function reads the file in chunks of a specified size and writes each chunk to a new file. The new files are named by appending `.fsp` and an index number to the original filename.

    ### Parameters:
    file (str): The name of the file to split.
    chunk_size (int): The size of each chunk. Defaults to 1048576 bytes (1 MB).

    ### Returns:
    True if the file was successfully split, False if the file does not exist.

    ### Raises:
    - FileNotFoundError: If the file does not exist.
    - PermissionError: If the permission is denied.

    ### Examples:
    - Splits a file into 1 MB chunks.

    ```python
    split_file("large_file")
    ```
    - Splits a file into chunks of a specified size.

    ```python
    split_file("large_file", 512000)  # splits into 500 KB chunks
    ```
