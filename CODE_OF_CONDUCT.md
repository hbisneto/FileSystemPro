# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and speak in a way that makes a safe, welcoming, and inclusive community for all.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility for our own speech and our own actions
* Participating in every discussion and decision of our community, either:

  * Positively contributing, or without disrupting the conversation
  * Choosing to politely excuse ourselves from conversations

* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community and the project

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [heitor.bardemaker@live.com](mailto:heitor.bardemaker@live.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders are responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct. They will follow our [enforcement guidelines](https://github.com/hbisneto/FileSystemPro/blob/main/ENFORCEMENT.md) which include:

- **Documenting Incidents**: Log all reports and actions taken.
- **Confidentiality**: Keep reports private unless explicit permission.
- **Escalation**: For severe cases, involve legal counsel or authorities if needed.
- **No Retaliation**: Protect reporters from backlash.
- **Appeals**: Allow moderated parties to appeal decisions.
