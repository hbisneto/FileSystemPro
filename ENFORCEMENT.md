# Enforcement Guidelines for FileSystemPro

This document outlines the process for handling reports of Code of Conduct violations in the FileSystemPro community. Our goal is to create a safe, inclusive environment where all participants feel welcome. Enforcement is carried out by the project maintainers, and we commit to handling all reports promptly, fairly, and transparently.

## Reporting a Violation

If you experience or witness behavior that violates the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please report it immediately. Reports should be sent to the project maintainers via:

- **Email**: [heitor.bardemaker@live.com](mailto:heitor.bardemaker@live.com)
- **GitHub Issue**: Open a private issue marked as "Security" or "Confidential" (if sensitive).
- **Direct Message**: DM @BisnetoDev on X (formerly Twitter) for urgent matters.

Your report should include:
- The nature of the incident (what happened, when, where—e.g., GitHub issue, PR, discussion).
- Involved parties (usernames/emails, without sharing private info).
- Any supporting evidence (screenshots, links—redact sensitive data).
- Impact on you or the community.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and keep you updated on progress.

## Confidentiality

All reports are handled confidentially. We will not disclose your identity without explicit permission. Reports are shared only with other maintainers as needed for investigation. If the report involves a minor, we may involve appropriate authorities.

## Investigation Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: Confirm receipt and assure confidentiality.
2. **Assessment**: Review the report against the Code of Conduct. If unclear, seek clarification.
3. **Gathering Facts**: Collect additional context from involved parties (anonymously where possible). We may temporarily suspend actions (e.g., close issues) during review.
4. **Decision**: Determine if a violation occurred and appropriate response (see below).
5. **Resolution**: Implement actions and notify reporter/outcome (without violating privacy).
6. **Follow-Up**: Check in with reporter post-resolution; update guidelines if patterns emerge.

Investigations aim to conclude within 7 days, but complex cases may take longer. Maintainers prioritize empathy and proportionality.

## Possible Responses

Responses are tailored to severity and context, focusing on harm reduction and education:

- **Warnings**: Private note to the individual, clarifying the issue and expected behavior.
- **Temporary Restrictions**: Limit participation (e.g., comment muting, PR blocking) for 1-4 weeks.
- **Permanent Bans**: Full exclusion from community spaces (e.g., repo access revoked).
- **Escalation**: For severe cases (e.g., threats), involve law enforcement or GitHub support.

No retaliation against reporters—any such behavior is a separate violation.

## Appeals

If you believe an enforcement action was unfair, appeal within 7 days via the same channels. Provide new evidence or context. Appeals are reviewed by at least two maintainers; decisions are final.

## Maintainers' Responsibilities

- **Training**: All maintainers review this document annually.
- **Logging**: Track reports/actions internally (anonymized) for transparency.
- **Updates**: Revise guidelines based on community feedback; announce changes.
