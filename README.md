# FileSystem Module

FileSystem provides a comprehensive suite of methods for managing and interacting with various directories and user folders across multiple operating systems. It intelligently identifies the user's operating system—Linux, macOS, or Windows—and configures file paths for essential directories like Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures, Public, and Videos. Leveraging Python's built-in libraries such as `os`, `sys`, and `getpass`, it ensures cross-platform compatibility and accurate path retrieval. For Windows environments, it uses the `winreg` module to query the Windows registry, ensuring the paths to these directories are accurately retrieved based on the system's registry settings. This makes FileSystem a versatile and reliable tool for any file management needs.

## Features

FileSystemPro introduces a range of features and enhancements to help you manage and monitor your system's devices more efficiently.

<details>
	<summary>Expand to learn about the features</summary>
	
- **Cross-platform Compatibility:** The code is designed to work on multiple operating systems, including Linux, Mac, and Windows. This makes it versatile and adaptable to different environments.
- **Directory Path Identification:** The code identifies and defines the paths to several common user directories based on the operating system. This includes directories like Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures, Public, Videos, and others.
- **String Formatting:** The code uses f-string formatting to create directory paths.
- **Device Module:** Includes powerful tools for managing and retrieving detailed information about your system's disks and CPU, such as disk partitions, CPU usage, and more.
- **Compression Module:** Responsible for creating, extracting, and reading compressed archive files in tar and zip formats. It leverages Python's built-in tarfile and zipfile modules to handle these operations efficiently.
- **Monitoring System (Watcher):** Acts as a monitoring system for the file system. It keeps track of all activities within the file system and provides real-time updates on any changes.
- **Change Tracking:** Records any changes made within the file system. This includes the creation of new files, modification of existing files, and deletion of files.
- **Integrity Maintenance:** This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where maintaining the integrity and up-to-date status of the file system is crucial. By tracking all changes, the Watcher helps ensure that the file system remains accurate and reliable.
- **Registry-Based Path Retrieval:** For Windows, the module now uses the `winreg` module to retrieve accurate paths from the Windows registry. It defines paths for the current user's home, Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures, Public, and Videos folders by querying the Windows registry keys.

> Please note that **GitHub (and PYPI) does not support colored text** in README files. This is due to the limitations of the markdown language used in GitHub (and PYPI) READMEs, which does not have built-in support for text color changes.

<details>
<summary>Console: Printing a red foreground text message</summary>

The following example shows how to print some red foreground texts using **Console**

```py
from filesystem import console as fsconsole

# This will print a spaced text to your print message
print(fsconsole.foreground.RED, "This is a warn message")

# This will print a no space text to your print message
print(fsconsole.foreground.RED + "This is another warn message")

# You can use f-string format to assign the color to your print
print(f'{fsconsole.foreground.RED}This is a new warn message{fsconsole.foreground.RESET}')

# This text will be printed without color (default)
print("This is a normal text")
```

Output:

<pre><code><span style="color: red;"> This is a warn message
This is another warn message
This is a new warn message</span>
<span">This is a normal text</span></code></pre>

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>Console: Printing a blue background text message</summary>

The following example shows how to print some blue background texts using **Console**

```py
from filesystem import console as fsconsole

# This will print a spaced text to your print message
print(fsconsole.background.BLUE, 'This is a blue background message')

# This will print a no space text to your print message
print(fsconsole.background.BLUE + 'This is another blue background message')

# You can use f-string format to assign the color to your print
print(f'{fsconsole.background.BLUE}This is a new blue background message{fsconsole.background.RESET}')

# This text will be printed without color (default)
print('This is a normal text')
```

Output:

<pre><code><span style="background-color: #ADD8E6;"> This is a blue background message
This is another blue background warn message
This is a new blue background message</span>
<span">This is a normal text</span></code></pre>

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>Console: Different foregrounds, backgrounds and styles</summary>

The following example shows how to print some texts with different backgrounds, foregrounds and styles using **Console**

```py
# Prints a red foreground text
print(f'{fsconsole.foreground.RED}Some red text')
# Prints a red foreground text with a green background
print(f'{fsconsole.background.GREEN}And with a green background{fsconsole.style.RESET_ALL}')
# Prints a dim normal text with no background
print(f'{fsconsole.style.DIM}And in dim text{fsconsole.style.RESET_ALL}')
# Prints a normal text
print('Back to normal color')
```

Output:

<pre><code><span style="color: red;">Some red text</span>
<span style="background-color: #90EE90; color: red">And with a green background</span>
<span style="color: #A9A9A9">And in dim text</span>
<span>Back to normal color</span>
</code></pre>

</details>

---

Remember, for the color changes to work, your Terminal must support ANSI escape sequences, which are used to set the color. Not all Terminals do, so if you’re not seeing the colors as expected, that could be why.

<summary>Wrapper: Has Extension</summary>

Checks if the given file path has an extension

```python
from filesystem import wrapper as wra

bool_extension = wra.has_extension("/path/to/file.txt")
print(bool_extension)
```

Output

```sh
True
```

This will return **True** because the file has an extension (.txt).

Checks if the given file path has an extension

```python
from filesystem import wrapper as wra

bool_extension = wra.has_extension("/path/to/file")
print(bool_extension)
```

Output

```sh
False
```

This will return **False** because the file does not have an extension.

# Watcher Module

Watcher serves as a monitoring system for the file system. It keeps track of any changes made within the file system, such as the creation of new files, modification of existing files, or deletion of files. This feature allows for real-time updates and can be particularly useful in scenarios where maintaining the integrity and up-to-date status of the file system is crucial.


## Features

Watcher could be useful in scenarios where you need to monitor changes to a file system, for example, in a backup system or a live syncing service.

<details>
	<summary>Expand to learn about the features</summary>
	
- **Initialization:** The constructor method init(self, root) initializes the Watcher object with a root directory to watch and saves the current state of the file system.

- **State Retrieval:** The get_state(self, path) method returns a dictionary of all files in the given path with their metadata.

- **Change Detection:** The diff(self) method compares the current state of the file system with the saved state to identify any changes (created, updated, or removed files) and returns a list of dictionaries with the metadata of changed files and the type of change.

- **String Representation:** The str(self) method returns a string representation of the Watcher object.
